This lab is to design a game for the first week of Harvar'ds CS50 course:

It's a judging tennis game, to determine quickly if the ball landed in or out. As the score gets higher the ball speeds up. Some drawbacks is that I couldn't find a robust way to prevent clicks of the button and hence, users were able to increase their score by spamming the right button. Also if I had a bit more time, I would have added different ball paths.
